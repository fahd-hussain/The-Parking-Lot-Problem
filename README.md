# The Parking Lot Problem

Lets assume that we have a parking lot with fixed dimension, and there is a large variety of cars, busses,
motorcycles and various other vehicles that need to be parked on it for long term. In the long term, we
do not care where the individual vehicles are, and if they are accessible or not, all that we care about is
to fit all of the vehicles on the lot.
